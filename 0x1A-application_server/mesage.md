Sir, 
I know you were on the Chrome Dev team at one time. Please I need your thoughts on my first
real team project which is going to start out as an MVP; it is an extension project that seeks
to redefine BookMark Management. Really, just link management with tags, description, categories, searchability, ease of use, and a bunch of other seinsible additions; but we are careful not go far beyond what the name says. So we call it BookMark Manager for the next generation.
Respects the rules of simplicity, ease of use and privacy.

Specifically, is it possible and sensible to make this a kind of an enhancement on top of the native chrome bookmarking feature?
What would you like to see in such a tool with claiming to be for the next generation?
Any thoughts on what should be included and possibly techniques? Of course we are open for an 
entirely new idea since we are still in the planning phase.
It is our plan to go offline-first in a later iteration using the Service Worker API.
Thanks in advance.
