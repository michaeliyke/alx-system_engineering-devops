# 0x08. Networking basics #1

> This project was on Regular Expression

## Summary

In computer networking, localhost is a hostname that refers to the current computer used to access it. The name localhost is reserved for loopback purposes.[1] It is used to access the network services that are running on the host via the loopback network interface. Using the loopback interface bypasses any local network interface hardware.
