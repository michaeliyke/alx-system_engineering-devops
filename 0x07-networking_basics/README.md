## Summary

The Open Systems Interconnection model ([OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)) is a conceptual model from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that "provides a common basis for the coordination of standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection."[2] In the OSI reference model, the communications between systems are split into seven different abstraction layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.


OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.

It is organized from the lowest level to the highest level:

The lowest level: layer 1 which is for transmission on physical layers with electrical impulse, light or radio signal
The highest level: layer 7 which is for application specific communication like SNMP for emails, HTTP for your web browser, etc
Keep in mind that the OSI model is a concept, it’s not even tangible. The OSI model doesn’t perform any functions in the networking process. It is a conceptual framework so we can better understand complex interactions that are happening. Most of the functionality in the OSI model exists in all communications systems.


I learnt about...

OSI Model
- What it is
- How many layers it has
- How it is organized

What is a LAN
- Typical usage
- Typical geographical size

What is a WAN
- Typical usage
- Typical geographical size

What is the Internet
- What is an IP address
- What are the 2 types of IP address
- What is localhost
- What is a subnet
- Why IPv6 was created

TCP/UDP
- What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema)
- What is the main difference between TCP and UDP
- What is a port
- Memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers
- What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network


## Requirements
